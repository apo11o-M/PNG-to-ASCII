# Convert Image to ASCII Art
---

Plans:
* Resize the image to a standard dimension, while maintaining aspect ratio
* Convert to grayscale (the reason for doing so is because characters are replaced based on their intensity)
* Create list of special characters to replace pixels with
* Classify and divide pixels into buckets or groups, based on their intensity
* Replace all pixels in a bucket with the corresponding special character
* Print the text into terminal or write into a file
* Profit!
